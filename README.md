# Personalized Fashion Advice App

This project aims to develop an app that detects user skin color and necessary body dimensions to provide personalized fashion advice. The main features include:

- **Personalized Fashion Curation**: Using skin color, body dimensions, and insights from fashion designers to curate personalized fashion advice tailored to the user's attributes.
- **Outfit Inspiration Board**: Maintaining a Pinterest-like outfit inspiration board, where every outfit is handpicked for the user based on well-established fashion principles and human expert input.
